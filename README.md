- Basic Python project (integrated with kivy) to utilize search/replace in bulk.
- The goal is to produce an Android app that will simplify RegEx expressions by removing all new-line characters and allowing cut/replacement of text, such as for easily modifying HTML/XML files in bulk (by files in a folder).
- Any UTF-8 filetype will be allowed.
